## Why Magna Docs?

Most documentation platforms force you to maintain a completely separate website alongside your application.

Whether you use **GitBook**, **VitePress**, **Docusaurus**, **MkDocs**, or **Docsify**, you end up managing:

- a separate repository
- Node.js dependencies and build pipelines
- separate deployment workflows
- a synchronization problem between your app and its docs

Magna Docs takes a different approach. It lives **inside your Laravel application** as a native plugin. Every page is stored in your database, rendered with Blade, cached automatically, and live on the next page refresh the instant you hit Publish.

There is nothing extra to build, deploy, or maintain.

## Features

### Full-Screen Markdown Editor

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/07-admin-edit-page.png" alt="Magna Docs full-screen Markdown editor" width="80%" />
</p>

The editor takes over the entire screen — Filament chrome disappears, leaving nothing but your content.

- Rich toolbar: bold, italic, strikethrough, links, headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, tables, file attachments
- **Dark / light mode toggle** that persists between sessions
- **Save Draft** saves silently without redirecting; **Publish / Update** goes live immediately
- Slug auto-generated from the title while you type — override any time

### Draft / Publish Workflow

- Every page starts as a **draft** — invisible to visitors until published
- Status badge in the sidebar: Draft / Published / Archived
- Publish date recorded automatically the moment a page goes live
- Topbar button switches to **Update** once a page is already published so you always know what you're doing

### Collections & Nested Pages

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/06-admin-collections.png" alt="Magna Docs collections management" width="80%" />
</p>

- **Collections** group related pages (Getting Started, API Reference, etc.) — each has a title, slug, description, icon, colour, and sort order
- **Nested pages** — any page can be a child of another via `parent_id`, giving unlimited depth
- The public sidebar is built automatically from this tree; no manual menu editing ever

### Auto Table of Contents

- Every `h2` and `h3` in the rendered page is extracted and displayed as a sticky anchor list in the right column
- All headings get permanent `#` permalink anchors via CommonMark's heading-permalink extension

### SEO — Zero Config

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/09-admin-settings.png" alt="Magna Docs settings page" width="80%" />
</p>

Every published page ships with:

- Unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type`)
- Twitter Card metadata
- JSON-LD structured data: `TechArticle` + `BreadcrumbList`
- Auto-generated `sitemap.xml` at `/docs/sitemap.xml` with `<lastmod>` per page

No plugins, no config files, no SEO package needed.

### Server-Rendered, No Build Step

The public frontend is pure Blade + CSS. Zero JavaScript frameworks are shipped to the browser.

- **No `npm run build`** after content changes
- **Instant live pages** — published content is visible on the next refresh
- **Automatic HTML caching** per page, keyed on `page_id:updated_at`, invalidated the moment a page is saved
- Excellent Core Web Vitals — fast FCP, fast LCP, no hydration delay

### Frontend — Light & Dark Mode

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/01-frontend-light.png" alt="Magna Docs public documentation light mode" width="49%" />
  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2026-07-12 162556.png" alt="Magna Docs public documentation dark mode" width="49%" />
</p>

### Mobile

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/10-frontend-mobile.png" alt="Magna Docs mobile responsive view" width="35%" />
</p>

Fully responsive — the sidebar collapses on mobile, and the layout adapts to any screen width.

### Additional Features

- **Featured image** — upload directly or pick from the Magna media library; toggle display per page
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — built automatically from the `parent_id` hierarchy
- **Prev / Next navigation** — cards at the bottom of each page, ordered by sidebar position
- **Reading time** — calculated from word count (~200 wpm), shown in the page footer
- **Last updated** — rendered from `updated_at`, always accurate
- **Page feedback widget** — "Was this page helpful? 👍 👎" stored locally, no third-party service

### REST API

Every published page is available as JSON for headless or mobile consumption:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/docs/tree` | Nested sidebar tree (collections → pages) |
| `GET /api/v1/docs/pages` | Flat list of all published pages |
| `GET /api/v1/docs/pages/{slug}` | Full content + breadcrumb for one page |

Example response for `/api/v1/docs/tree`:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Getting Started",
    "slug": "getting-started",
    "children": [
      { "title": "Installation", "slug": "installation" },
      { "title": "Configuration", "slug": "configuration" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Useful for Next.js frontends, mobile apps, search indexing, and AI assistants.

## Magna Docs vs GitBook

GitBook is one of the most popular documentation platforms today. It offers an excellent writing experience — but it is primarily a **cloud-hosted SaaS product**.

| | Magna Docs | GitBook |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting | Self-hosted inside your app | Cloud SaaS (paid for teams) |
| Data ownership | Your database, your server | GitBook's servers |
| Authentication | Shared with your Laravel app | Separate GitBook account |
| Monthly cost | Free (open source) | Paid after free tier |
| Laravel integration | Native | None |
| Admin panel | Filament 5 inside your app | Separate GitBook UI |
| REST API | Built-in | Paid plans |

If your application already runs on Laravel, Magna Docs eliminates the need to manage documentation on a separate platform with a separate login, separate billing, and separate deployment.

---

## Magna Docs vs Docusaurus

Docusaurus is an excellent static site generator from Meta, widely used for open-source project documentation.

The fundamental difference: every documentation change in Docusaurus requires a **rebuild and redeploy**.

**Docusaurus workflow:**
1. Edit Markdown file
2. Commit to Git
3. Push to trigger CI
4. Build (`npm run build`) — takes minutes
5. Deploy to hosting
6. Wait for CDN propagation

**Magna Docs workflow:**
1. Edit page in admin
2. Click **Publish**
3. Refresh browser

No Node.js. No build. No deployment. No waiting.

| | Magna Docs | Docusaurus |
|---|---|---|
| Requires Node.js | ❌ | ✅ |
| Build step on every edit | ❌ | ✅ |
| Deploy after edits | ❌ | ✅ |
| Live publishing | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit inside admin panel | ✅ | ❌ |
| Database-backed content | ✅ | ❌ |
| Shared media library | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## Magna Docs vs VitePress

VitePress is lightweight and fast, but it still depends on Node.js and static site generation. Every content update requires running the build and redeploying.

| Task | Magna Docs | VitePress |
|---|---|---|
| Requires Node.js | ❌ | ✅ |
| `npm install` on setup | ❌ | ✅ |
| Build after editing | ❌ | ✅ |
| Deploy after editing | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit inside admin panel | ✅ | ❌ |
| Database storage | ✅ | ❌ |
| Role-based editor access | ✅ | ❌ |
| Shared app authentication | ✅ | ❌ |

For Laravel teams already using Filament, Magna Docs provides a far more integrated experience — no separate toolchain, no separate user accounts, no separate deployment.

---

## Magna Docs vs MkDocs

MkDocs is popular for Python projects and technical documentation. Like Docusaurus and VitePress, it generates **static HTML at build time**.

Magna Docs focuses on **dynamic documentation management** — editors update content without touching Git repositories or running build commands. The content team and the engineering team share one admin panel, one media library, and one permission system.

---

## Magna Docs vs BookStack

BookStack is a solid self-hosted knowledge management platform. It serves a slightly different audience:

- **BookStack** is optimised for company-wide knowledge sharing, internal wikis, and team information
- **Magna Docs** is optimised for **public-facing developer documentation** — product docs, API references, installation guides, SaaS documentation

Magna Docs also integrates natively with Magna CMS and Filament, giving you a single admin panel for your entire application.

---

## Architecture

```
Visitor Request
       │
       ▼
  Laravel Router
       │
       ▼
  DocsPageController
       │
       ├── Cache hit? ──→ Return cached HTML immediately
       │
       ▼
  DocPage model (Eloquent)
       │
       ▼
  CommonMark parser
       │
       ▼
  Blade templates
       │
       ▼
  Cache HTML (keyed on page_id:updated_at)
       │
       ▼
  Visitor receives fully rendered HTML
```

Unlike JavaScript documentation frameworks, there is no client-side rendering, no hydration, and no JavaScript framework shipped to the visitor.

---

## Performance

- **Server-side rendering** — pages are Blade-rendered HTML; no React or Vue runtime in the browser
- **Automatic per-page caching** — rendered HTML cached immediately after first render
- **Instant cache invalidation** — only the updated page's cache is cleared when you save; no "clear all" button
- **Lightweight frontend** — Blade, CSS, and a small amount of vanilla JS only
- **Fast Core Web Vitals** — better FCP, better LCP, reduced JS execution, improved accessibility

---

## Security

Magna Docs inherits Laravel's built-in security model:

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Authentication and authorization policies
- Role-based permissions (shared with the rest of the CMS)
- Request validation
- Escaped Blade templates (XSS-safe by default)
- Secure file uploads via Magna media library

No third-party authentication service required.

---

## Installation

> **Coming soon — one-click install:** Magna CMS will ship a built-in plugin marketplace where you can install Magna Docs with a single click from the admin panel — no terminal, no `composer.json` edits, no file copying. The steps below cover the v1.0 manual path.

### Prerequisites

You need a running [Magna CMS](https://github.com/jish-44/Magna) instance. Magna Docs is a **plugin** for Magna CMS — it is not a standalone application.

### 1. Add the plugin to your plugins directory

```bash
# From the root of your Magna CMS installation
git clone https://github.com/jish-44/Magna-Docs.git plugins-dev/magna/docs
```

Your directory structure should look like:

```
your-magna-cms/
├── app/
├── plugins-dev/
│   └── magna/
│       └── docs/          ← plugin lives here
│           ├── magna.json
│           ├── composer.json
│           └── src/
└── ...
```

### 2. Register the plugin path in your root `composer.json`

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "path", "url": "plugins-dev/magna/docs" }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Require the package

```bash
composer require magna/docs:@dev
```

### 4. Enable from the admin panel

Go to **Admin → Plugins**, find **Magna Docs**, and click **Enable**.

Enabling the plugin automatically runs database migrations and registers all routes, admin resources, and permissions. No `php artisan migrate` needed.

---

## Usage

### Creating your first page

1. In the admin sidebar, go to **Magna Docs → Create Page**
2. Type your title — the slug is auto-generated
3. Write content in Markdown using the full-screen editor
4. Optionally assign to a **Collection** and set a **parent page** for nesting
5. Click **Publish page** — it's live at `/docs/{slug}` immediately

### Organising with Collections

1. Go to **Magna Docs → Collections** and create a collection (e.g. "Getting Started")
2. When editing a page, pick the collection in the **Organisation** sidebar panel
3. Pages are grouped by collection in the public sidebar, ordered by the `order` field

### Setting up branding

Go to **Magna Docs → Settings** to set site name, logo, and favicon. These affect only the docs section and do not change anything else in your CMS.

### Restricting editor access

In **Magna Docs → Settings → Permissions**, select which admin roles can create and edit pages. Leave empty to allow all admin roles.
